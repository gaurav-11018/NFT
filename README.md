Ultimate NFT project using hardhat.

I have done a NFT projects before using brownie,however this time I plan on using hardhat and make it very very eloborate super excited to be working on this.....


We go through creating 3 different kinds of NFTs.

1.A Basic NFT  ✅


2. Randomized IPFS Hosted NFT  ✅

=> That uses Randomness to generate a unique NFT


3.SVG NFT (Hosted 100% on-chain)

=> Uses price feeds to be dynamic



*will update the README as soon as am done with the project*
